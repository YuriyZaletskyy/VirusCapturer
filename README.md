# VirusCapturer
Recently I had situation that some files were downloaded to my computer and executed without mine permission and desire.
Avast weren't able to stop those files from execution and appearing at mine system. So in order to fix it I've created simple
application into which I've hardcoded list of unwanted files that tracks their appearing at hard drive and kills them ASAP.
Feel free to improve the code, use it according to your wishes.

P.S. I'm thankful to everybody who advices me to reinstall Windows. I'm aware about such option almost from infancy.
But in mine case I can't stop production server for any time. So this is workable workaround for sucy system
