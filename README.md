# VirusCapturer
Recently I had situation that some files were downloaded to my computer and executed without mine permission and desire.
Avast weren't able to stop those files from execution and appearing at mine system. So in order to fix it I've created simple
application into which I've hardcoded list of unwanted files that tracks their appearing at hard drive and kills them ASAP.
Feel free to improve the code, use it according to your wishes.
